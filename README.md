## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I'm happy with my use of the CSS Flexbox to organise the layout.

I created the web page to a height of 95vh (view height) as I found 100vh results in the scroll bar appearing.

### Continued development

I may attempt this later on using other techniques such as CSS Grid as I have less experience with it than with Flexbox.


### Useful resources
